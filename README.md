# flutter_counter_with_shared_state
 This Flutter project is a simple example demonstrating the use of InheritedWidget for state management in a widget tree. The app features a counter that can be incremented, and the updated counter value is shared across different parts of the widget hierarchy using an InheritedWidget.
